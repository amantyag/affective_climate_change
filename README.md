## Stance Results Validation
We randomly sampled 500 users from each group to manually validate the results. We label a user as Disbeliever if we find any Tweet akin to someone who does not believe in climate change or anthropogenic cause of climate change. Otherwise, we label the user as Believer. We observe that the average precision from manual validation of 1000 users is 81.8\%. We use the parameter values as defined in (Kumar 2020) as k = 5000, p = 5000, &theta;(I) = 0.1, &theta;(U) = 0.0, &theta;(T) = 0.7.
